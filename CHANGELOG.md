- release built with Go version 11, which includes a fix for a CIFS error that caused files to be skipped during file walk; reported by [Maarten Savels](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/115)

## v1.7.9 (2018-08-30)
### Added
- save defaults in a configuration file: use the -setconf flag to record any other flags used into a config file. These defaults will be loaded each time you run sf. E.g. `sf -multi 16 -setconf` then `sf DIR` (loads the new multi default)
- use `-conf filename` to save or load from a named config file. E.g. `sf -multi 16 -serve :5138 -conf srv.conf -setconf` and then `sf -conf srv.conf` 
- added `-yaml` flag so, if you set json/csv in default config :(, you can override with YAML instead. Choose the YAML!

### Changed
- the `roy compare -join` options that join on filepath now work better when comparing results with mixed windows and unix paths
- exported decompress package to give more functionality for users of the golang API; requested by [Byron Ruth](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/119)
- update LOC signatures to 2018-06-14
- update freedesktop.org signatures to v1.10
- update tika-mimetype signatures to v1.18

### Fixed
- misidentifications of some files e.g. ODF presentation due to sf quitting early on strong matches. Have adjusted this algorithm to make sf wait longer if there is evidence (e.g. from filename) that the file might be something else. Reported by [Jean-Séverin Lair](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/112)
- read and other file errors caused sf to hang; reports by [Greg Lepore and Andy Foster](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/113); fix contributed by [Ross Spencer](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/commit/ea5300d3639d741a451522958e8b99912f7d639d)
- bug reading streams where EOF returned for reads exactly adjacent the end of file
- bug in mscfb library ([race condition for concurrent access to a global variable](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/117))
- some matches result in extremely verbose basis fields; reported by [Nick Krabbenhoeft](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/111). Partly fixed: basis field now reports a single basis for a match but work remains to speed up matching for these cases.

## v1.7.8 (2017-12-02)
### Changed
- update LOC signatures to 2017-09-28
- update PRONOM signatures to v93

## v1.7.7 (2017-11-30)
### Added
- version information for MIME-info signatures (freedesktop.org and tika-mimetypes) now recorded in mime-info.json file and presented in results
- new sets file for PRONOM extensions. This creates sets like @.doc and @.txt (i.e. all PUIDs with those extensions). Allows you to do commands like `roy build -limit @.doc,@.docx`, `roy inspect @.txt` and `sf -log @.pdf,o DIR`

### Changed
- update freedesktop.org signatures to v1.9

### Fixed
- out of memory error when using `sf -z` on compressed files that contain very large files; reported by [Terry Jolliffe](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/109)
- report errors that occur during file decompression. Previously, only fatal errors encountered when a compressed file is first opened were reported. Now errors that are encountered while attempting to walk the contents of a compressed file are also reported. 
- report errors for 'roy inspect' when roy can't find anything to inspect; reported by [Ross Spencer](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/108)

## v1.7.6 (2017-10-04)
### Added
- continue on error flag (-coe) can now be used to continue scans despite fatal file errors that would normally cause scanning to halt. This may be useful e.g. for big directory scans over unreliable networks. Usage: `sf -coe DIR`

### Changed
- update PRONOM signatures to v92

### Fixed
- file scanning is now restricted to regular files (i.e. not symlinks, sockets, devices etc.). Reported by [Henk Vanstappen](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/107).
- windows longpath fix now works for paths that appear short

## v1.7.5 (2017-08-12)
### Added
- `sf -update` flag can now be used to download/update non-PRONOM signatures. Options are "loc", "tika", "freedesktop", "pronom-tika-loc", "deluxe" and "archivematica". To update a non-PRONOM signature, include the signature name as an argument after the flags e.g. `sf -update freedesktop`. This command will overwrite 'default.sig' (the default signature file that sf loads). You can preserve your default signature file by providing an alternative `-sig` target e.g. `sf -sig notdefault.sig -update loc`. If you use one of the signature options as a filename (with or without a .sig extension), you can omit the signature argument i.e. `sf -update -sig loc.sig` is equivalent to `sf -sig loc.sig -update loc`. Feature requested by [Ross Spencer](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/103).
- `sf -update` now does SHA-256 hash verification of updates and communication with the update server is via HTTPS.

### Changed
- update PRONOM signatures to v91

### Fixed
- fixes to config package where global variables are polluted with subsquent calls to the Add(Identifier) function
- fix to reader package where panic triggered by illegal slice access in some cases

## v1.7.4 (2017-07-14)
### Added
- `roy build` and `roy add` now take a `-nobyte` flag to omit byte signatures from the identifier; requested by [Nick Krabbenhoeft](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/102) 

### Changed
- update Tika MIMEInfo signatures to 1.16
- update LOC to 2017-06-10

## v1.7.3-(x) (2017-05-30)
### Fixed
- no changes since v1.7.3, repairing Travis-CI auto-deploy of Debian packages

## v1.7.3 (2017-05-20)
### Added
- sf now accepts multiple files or directories as input e.g. `sf myfile1.doc mydir myfile3.txt`
- LOC signature update

### Changed
- code re-organisation to export reader and writer packages
- `sf -replay` can now take lists of results files with `-f` flag e.g. `sf -replay -f list-of-results.txt`

### Fixed
- the command `sf -replay -` now works on Windows as expected e.g. `sf myfiles | sf -replay -json -`
- text matcher not allocating hits to correct identifiers; fixes [#101](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/101)
- unescaped YAML field contains quote; reported by [Ross Spencer](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/100)

## v1.7.2 (2017-04-4)
### Added
- PRONOM v90 update

### Fixed
- the -home flag was being overriden for roy subcommands due to interaction other flags

## v1.7.1 (2017-03-12)
### Added
- signature updates for PRONOM, LOC and tika-mimetypes

### Changed
- `roy inspect` accepts space as well as comma-separated lists of formats e.g. `roy inspect fmt/1 fmt/2`

## v1.7.0 (2017-02-17)
### Added
- log files that match particular formats with `-log fmt/1,@set2` (comma separated list of format IDs/format sets). These can be mixed with regular log options e.g. `-log unknown,fmt/1,chart`
- generate a summary view of formats matched during a scan with `-log chart` (or just `-log c`)
- replay scans from results files with `sf -replay`: load one or more results files to replay logging or to convert to a different output format e.g. `sf -replay -csv results.yaml` or `sf -replay -log unknown,chart,stdout results1.yaml results2.csv`
- compare results with `roy compare` subcommand: view the difference between two or more results e.g. `roy compare results1.yaml results2.csv droid.csv ...`
- `roy sets` subcommand: `roy sets` creates pronom-all.json, pronom-families.json, and pronom-types.json sets files;
`roy sets -changes` creates a pronom-changes.json sets file from a PRONOM release-notes.xml file; `roy sets -list @set1,@set2` lists contents of a comma-separated list of format sets
- `roy inspect releases` provides a summary view of a PRONOM release-notes.xml file

### Changed
- the `sf -` command now scans stdin e.g. `cat mypdf.pdf | sf -`. You can pass a filename in to supplement the analysis with the `-name` flag. E.g. `cat myfile.pdf | sf -name myfile.pdf -`. In previous versions of sf, the dash argument signified treating stdin as a newline separated list of filenames for scanning. Use the new `-f` flag for this e.g. `sf -f myfiles.txt` or `cat myfiles.txt | sf -f -`; change requested by [pm64](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/96)

### Fixed
- some files cause endless scanning due to large numbers of signature hits; reported by [workflowsguy](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/94)
- null bytes can be written to output due to bad zip filename decoding; reported by [Tim Walsh](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/95)

## v1.6.7 (2016-11-23)
### Added
- enable -hash, -z, and -log flags for -serve and -multi modes
- new hash, z, and sig params for -serve mode (to control per-request)
- enable droid output in -serve mode
- GET requests in -serve mode now just percent encoded (with base64 option as a param)
- -serve mode landing page now includes example forms

### Changed
- code re-organisation using /internal directory to hide internal packages
- Identify method now returns a slice rather than channel of IDs (siegfried pkg change)

## v1.6.6 (2016-10-25)
### Added
- graph implicit and missing priorities with `roy inspect implicit-priorities` and `roy inspect missing-priorities`

### Fixed
- error parsing mimeinfo signatures with double backslashes (e.g. rtf signatures)

## v1.6.5 (2016-09-28)
### Added
- new sets files (pronom-families.json and pronom-types) automatically created from PRONOM classficiations. Removed redundant sets (database, audio, etc.).

### Fixed
- debbuilder.sh fix: debian packages were copying roy data to wrong directory

### Changed
- roy inspect priorities command now includes "orphan" fmts in graphs
- update PRONOM urls from apps. to www.

## v1.6.4 (2016-09-05)
### Added
- roy inspect FMT command now inspects sets e.g. roy inspect @pdfa
- roy inspect priorities command generates graphs of priority relations

### Fixed
- [container matcher running when empty](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/90) (i.e. for freedesktop/tika signature files and when -nocontainer flag used with PRONOM)
- [-doubleup flag preventing signature extensions loading](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/92): since v1.3.0 signature extensions included with the -extend flag haven't been loading properly due to interaction with the doubles filter (which prevents byte signatures loading for formats that also have container signatures defined)

### Changed
- use fwac rather than wac package for performance
- roy inspect FMT command speed up by building without reports and without the doubles filter
- -reports flag removed for roy harvest and roy build commands
- -reports flag changed for roy inspect command, now a boolean that, if set, will cause the signature(s) to be built from the PRONOM report(s), rather than the DROID XML file. This is slower but can be a more accurate representation.

## v1.6.3 (2016-08-18)
### Added
- roy inspect FMT command now gives details of all signatures, [including container signatures](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/88)

### Fixed
- misidentification: [x-fmt/45 files misidentified as fmt/40](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/89) due to repetition of elements in container file
- roy build -noreports includes blank extensions that generate false matches; reported by [Ross Spencer](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/87)

## v1.6.2 (2016-08-08)
